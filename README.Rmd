```
Begin by loading the required libraries as follows.

```
Setup the JBC driver environment and connection details.
```r
jdbcDrivers <- new.env()
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms = "yourDatabase", server = "yourServer",user = "yourUserName", password = "yourPassword",port = "yourPort")
```
Provide database schema name and other details as follows.

```r
cdmDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfYourCdmSchema"
resultsDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfResultsSchema"
targetDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfResultsSchema"
targetCohortTable <- "studyCohort" #do not change this.
results_path <- "path to results folder" #where you want the results to be saved.
cdmVersion <- "5" #do not change this. Please note, this study can only be executed on CDMV5
numThread <- c(numericValue) #eg. 8 for 8 threads. Give as much as you can :) 
```

You are all set. The entire study can now be ececuted with single command by executing runStudy function as shown below.

```r
set.seed(24)
runStudy(connectionDetails,cdm_database_schema,results_database_schema,target_database_schema,target_cohort_table,numThread)
```

Time of execution can vary from few hours to day or two, depending on the size of the dataset you have.
